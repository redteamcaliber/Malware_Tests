## How does this plugin differ from true Antivirus software?

The Malware plugin in Watchman Monitoring is a lightweight test designed to locate the most common strains of Malware on the Mac platform.

It is not the intent for this simple plugin to replace a full fledged antivirus system, however in lieu of nothing, this plugin acts as a nice tool somewhere between Apple's Xprotect alone, and more aggressive antivirus product.


##How the tests work
During the agent's hourly run, the malware discovery plugin tests for the presence of key files, processes, and launchd jobs known to correspond to a known piece of malware/adware.

##Warnings versus Informational Reports
There are a number of cases where a file may be in place, but not causing issues in and of itself. There are also times when a piece of software may, or may not be "Malware". To prevent false positives, especially in cases where an average end-user may not agree there's a problem, the reporting will return as informational in the Watchman Monitoring Dashboard.

##Relative Locations
Many files will have variants in their name, or path. They are indicated by `**` below, and will have an application's name if our agent is checking through all available profiles on a computer. i.e. `*Chrome*` indicates that each profile in each home directory would be inspected.
